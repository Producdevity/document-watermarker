# Document-Watermarker

Welcome to `document-watermarker`! This project was supposed to save me time by adding watermarks on my identification documents, like passports and ID cards, using a terminal command. Whether you're applying for a job or just need to mark your documents for any other reason, `document-watermarker` has got you covered.

## Why `document-watermarker`?

I initially created this tool to add watermarks to my ID documents when applying for jobs. But hey, why stop there? You can use it for pretty much anything that needs a watermark. Think of it as your personal stamp of uniqueness on your documents.

## How much time did it save me?

Hear me out. It's like buying a sports car to save time on your commute, only to realize you work from home. Sure, I didn't save time, but now I've got this fancy tool I didn't really need! ¯_(ツ)_/¯

### Saving Time in Style

Let's be honest, adding watermarks manually is a bit of a drag. `document-watermarker` not only adds a layer of professional flair to your documents but also saves precious time. I mean, we're talking about 3 to 4 minutes a year here – totally worth it in my opinion!

## Features

- **Easy Watermarking**: Add watermarks to images and PDFs with a simple command.
- **Customizable**: No not really, take it or leave it.
- **Efficiency**: Process your documents in a jiffy.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add support for choosing your own watermark text.
- [ ] Add support for more document types, with smart placement of the watermark (e.g. driver's license, birth certificate, etc.)
- [ ] Add support for more watermark types (e.g. image, logo, etc.)
- [ ] Add support for more languages (e.g. German, French, etc.)

## How to Use
